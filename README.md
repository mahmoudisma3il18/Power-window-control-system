# Power Window Control System

## Overview
The **Power Window Control System** is designed for a vehicle's front passenger door, allowing users to control the window from both the passenger and driver's side. The system incorporates manual open/close functions as well as a convenient one-touch auto open/close feature. Safety mechanisms, such as jam protection and window lock functions, enhance user safety and control.

## Key Features
1. **FreeRTOS Implementation**: The system utilizes FreeRTOS, a real-time operating system, for efficient process management.
2. **Manual and Auto Functions**: Users can manually operate the window or use the one-touch auto feature.
3. **Safety Measures**: Jam protection and window lock functions prevent accidents and enhance safety.
4. **Hardware Components**: The system includes a Tiva C microcontroller, limit switches, a DC motor, push buttons, and an ON/OFF switch.
5. **Control Logic**: A Finite State Machine (FSM) approach, based on MATLAB's "Simulink Power Window Controller Specification," governs the system's behavior.
